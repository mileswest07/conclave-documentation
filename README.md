Graphics were ripped by me, and are used here without express permission and without intent to profit.

All Castlevania: Symphony of the Night game graphics were made and owned by Konami Group Corporation. Graphics were ripped by online contributors, and are used here without express permission and without intent to profit.

Rogue Dawn graphics were made by the Rogue Dawn creators, ripped by me, and are used here without express permission and without intent to profit.

All custom-made Metroid: Zero Mission-style sprites were custom-made by Miles07 and Ridleymaster, intending to mimic or approximate an officially-owned graphical style (i.e. Nintendo's Metroid: Zero Mission graphical style) without intent to profit.

All colorblind-mode Metroid placeholder icons were custom-made or kitbashed by me, intending to mimic or approximate an officially-owned graphical style (i.e. Nintendo's Metroid: Other M graphical style) without intent to profit.
